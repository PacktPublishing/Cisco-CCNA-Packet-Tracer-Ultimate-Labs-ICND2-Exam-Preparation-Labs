## About the Video Course
This course tests your knowledge of CCNA topics with practical, hands-on labs, including both configuration as well as troubleshooting labs. This course helps you prepare for the exam and gain the confidence to pass it! There are many topologies and many labs in this course! Networks are all around us and you are using one right now to access this course. Imagine, for a moment, how different your life would be without access to Facebook, Snapchat, Google, YouTube, Whatsapp, or any other websites on the internet? How would you live with no internet?. The internet is extremely important in modern life today and all websites and internet communication rely on networking. This reliance is only predicted to continue with the growth of the internet of Things (IoT) in the next few years. Without routers, switches, network cabling, and protocols such as BGP, there would be no internet! This course will teach you how networks actually work and how you are able to connect to websites like Facebook, Google, and YouTube. Companies throughout the world (from the smallest to the largest) rely on networks designed, installed, and maintained by networking engineers. Join this in-demand industry! By the end of this course, you will be able to confidently discuss networking topics and start configuring real networking devices such as routers and switches. This is an introductory course, but contains a lot of information that can be directly applied to the CCNA certification.
